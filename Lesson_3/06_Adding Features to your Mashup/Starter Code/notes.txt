findARestaurant.py
- The meal type and location in human-readable form are passed into the findARestaurant function.  
- The findARestaraunt function:
    - makes a GET request to Google's Geocoding API via the function getGeocodeLocation to return the latitude and longitude of a search on a city.
    - returns restaraunt details (id, img url, name and address) via a Forsquare API GET request that uses the longitude, latitude and meal type (and API keys)
    - "No Restaraunts Found" if venues do not return for search on city and mealType.

The function findARestaurant is imported from findARestaurant.py and is used by views.py (our main server (controller)) to generate jsons of restaurant data that are used to populate our restaurant database.

SQLite is an “embedded” database which means it’s server-less and can run within your app.

PostgreSQL on the other hand works based on a client-server model which requires a DB server to set up and run over the network.

I chose PostgreSQL for my app for flexibility and I had a TON of data with a lot of table interdependency (relationships).  I had about 5 tables of data and needed to build complex queries for my data visualizations in Chart.js and D3.

Descriptors are a low-level mechanism that lets you hook into an object's attributes being accessed.
